## You can always count on me when...

There is an occasion to go peanut because if so, I could be the one you're looking for :)  
  
If you know I know something, don't hesitate I will always be glad to help you. And if I can't, I'll search for someone who can 
( Also called "After sales services").  
  
I can also have good ideas, which can be turned in a  weird and confuse big nonsense stuff if you don't contain me, and help me to focus.  
  
## Funny story 

That day before the lockdown when I visited a friend of mine. That friend kindly asked if I could drop some glasses ( like 10 bottles ...) 
in the glasses bubbles, adding that it would be easier if I was opening the hatch instead of drop it one by one. So I opened the hatch and 
my car key fall in that freaking glass Bubble... And PAF no car anymore, because of course I just had one key. It was in the afternoon and 
at 8PM we were, me and my BF trying to buy some Junky to get down there (What, not decent ? Well, they are thin and I've tried myself but
 I stay stucked).  
  
So I waited 3 months for my new key, my friend is still laughing at me with everyone and sometimes I meet people she knows and they say : 
Hey that's you the girl who dropped her key in the glass bubbles ?   
  
Yeah ... it's me, glad to be a legend dude, really :')  
  
##### TL;DR : 

**Lazy you...**

You have a zipper on your pocket ? Well, use it... you don't know where your key will fall if you don't ...
